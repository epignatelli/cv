        {I am conducting research on the temporal credit assignment problem in non-stationary reinforcement learning, and how \textit{credit} and \textit{optimal credit} can be formally defined. The position is funded by a scholarship from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).}

        {I defended the thesis “Computational morphogenesis and construction of an acoustic shell for outdoor chamber music”. \\Implementing numerical methods that uses geometrical acoustics, computational physics, descriptive geometry and genetic algorithms, the thesis presents a novel generative method to design a passive acoustic shell for outdoor classical music. Both in silico results and on-site measurements show that it outperforms the state of the art of the design of outdoor acoustic chambers.}
