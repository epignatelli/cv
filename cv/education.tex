            I defended the thesis “Computational morphogenesis and construction of an acoustic shell for outdoor chamber music”. \\Implementing numerical methods that uses geometrical acoustics, computational physics, descriptive geometry and genetic algorithms, the thesis presents a novel generatsive method to design a passive acoustic shell for outdoor classical music. Both in silico results and on-site measurements show that it outperforms the state of the art of the design of outdoor acoustic chambers.}
